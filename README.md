# shortJSON
shortJSON is for when you just need a simple JSON parser for your project and not a monster with thousands of lines of code and/or spread across so many files you'll never be able to understand it.  In total it's fewer than 400 lines and interprets weird strings from EMCAScript that other parsers wouldn't translate properly.  It relies heavily on the STL and uses C++17 features therfore it is not suited for deeply embedded systems.

Feel free to just copy this into your project without attribution.
