# shortJSON
shortJSON is for when you just need a simple JSON parser for your project and not a monster with thousands of lines of code and/or spread across so many files you'll never be able to understand it.

It's neither optimized for speed or binary size but instead for brevity by using C++17 STL features.  In total it's about 300 lines and interprets strings from EMCAScript that other parsers wouldn't translate properly.

Feel free to use shortJSON in your project without attribution.
